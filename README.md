Small Machine Little Language.

Small Machine Little Language is a small virtual machine that can run its own assembly language using special instructions that works like a real CPU
I made this project to get a better understanding of how computers and languages work, this project includes it own assembler that breaks down the source file into tokens and then assembles them into a machine-like code. The next part is the interpreter or VM that takes the generated code and executes and preforms action defined by the instructions.

This VM can allows you to preform mathematical operations decision-making using Jump instructions and control flow I included a small set of examples that shows the project in action.
